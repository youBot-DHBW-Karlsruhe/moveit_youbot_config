# KUKA youBot Configuration Repository
This repository contains the [moveit](http://moveit.ros.org/) configuration and launch files for our [KUKA youBot](http://www.youbot-store.com/kuka-youbot-omni-directional-mobile-platform-with-arm), which were generated by the moveit setup assistant. We added custom configuration files, launch files and URDF-files applicable for our needs.

You can find our youBot configuration guide [here](youBot_setup.md), which explains all steps required to run the launch-files in this repository.

## How to use the moveit setup assistant
If you want to use moveit with the KUKA youBot, you have to configure moveit correctly. This is done by running the moveit setup assistant. At first install the moveit ROS package:
``` bash
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-moveit-full
```
After that follow the [online tutorial of the setup assistant](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html) to configure moveit for the youBot. The online tutorial is written for the R2, but can easily be adopted to the youBot.
